Online flatbuffer compiler:
http://flatbuffers.ar.je

Observe: The generated rust file produced rust compiler errors (SafeSliceAccess). Therefore, installed flatbuffer compiler and the resulting file worked just fine. Installation from source, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55394537/how-to-install-flatc-and-flatbuffers-on-linux-ubuntu and answer by Corey Cole.
